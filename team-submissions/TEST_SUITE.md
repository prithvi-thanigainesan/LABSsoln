My verification strategy was all verification, ensuring vibe coding resulted in mathematically and physically consistent code. I decided on three specific tests to guarantee sufficient code verification: a mathematical baseline check using a proven N=4 sequence to verify the autocorrelation indices, a physical symmetry test to ensure that E(S) always equals E(−S), and a hardware parity check comparing CPU-based loops against my vectorized CuPy kernels. These particular tests were chosen to catch common AI hallucinations such as incorrect axis alignments or off by one errors in array slicing that are often raised during the fast generation of complex GPU logic. By integrating this tests.py, I was able to validate that the transition to 200 parallel search agents on the NVIDIA L4 was achieved without sacrificing the integrity of the energy calculations.
